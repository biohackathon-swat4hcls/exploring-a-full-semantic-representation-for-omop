# Introduction

As part of the SWAT4HCLS 2024 BioHackathon, we set to explore what full semantic representation of OMOP could provide. OMOP is a widely used standard to represent Real World Data (RWD) in a standardized way. A significant efforts in its specification andsupporting processes relates to the standardization of ontologies. Howwever, these are intended to normalise categorical values. The structure of the model itself is represented as a relational model with limited attention to semantics. In this hackathon we set to explore how a full semantic representation could be achieved, and what it could entail.

This document use Markdown and you can look at [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Werking thread: modeling RWD

In this thread, different representations of RWD have been overviewed (e.g.: OMOP, FHIR,...). Ideas is to define an upper ontolgy to properly model RWD, and some shapes expressions to validate data for conformance to this model.
## Oveview of RWD models
_>> Material from the slide deck edited at the hackathon_
## Toward an upper model for RWD
_>> Discussions on the upper model (Michele, Deepak ?)_

## Working thread, understanding the Semantic of OMOP
_>> Here example findigs on the imprecise semantics of OMOP. E.g.: medicament start date could be the date of injection or prescription_

## Benefit us "semantic OMOP" for OMOP use cases
_>> Here we have the graph and some bits and scripts from connecting OMOP to molecular data: Andrea, Cythas_
